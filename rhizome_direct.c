/*
  Rhizome Direct (github issue #9)
  @author Paul Gardner-Stephen <paul@servalproject.org>

  The base rhizome protocol allows the automatic and progressive transfer of data
  bundles (typically files and their associated meta-data) between devices sharing
  a common network interface.

  There are several use-cases where that is insufficient, e.g.:

  1. User wishes to cause two near-by devices to completely synchronise, e.g., as
  part of a regular data courier activity, or a field operation centre wishing to
  extract all field-collected data from a device, and possibly provide the field
  device with updated operational information and software.

  2. Two remote devices wish to synchronise, e.g., redundant Serval Rhizome servers
  forming part of a humanitarian or governmental emergency/disaster response
  capability.

  3. As (2), but with regular synchronisation.

  In all cases what is required is a mechanism for one Serval daemon instance to
  communicate via another Serval daemon instance, and determine the bundles that
  need to be transfered in each direction, and effect those transfers.

  Several challenges complicate this objective:

  1. Network Address Translation (NAT) or some other barrier may make it impossible
  for one of the devices to initiate a TCP connection to the other device.  Thus
  the protocol must be able to operate "one-sided", yet be able to synchronise
  bundles in both directions.

  2. The protocol must not impair the real-time requirements of the Serval daemon
  at either end. Therefore the protocol must be implemented in a separate thread
  or process.  As the Serval design is for single-threaded processes to improve
  portability and reliability, a separate process will be used.  That separate
  process will be another instance of the Serval daemon that will be run from the
  command line, and terminate when the synchronisation has completed, or when it
  receives an appropriate signal.  This approach also ensures that the Rhizome 
  databases at each end will always be consistent (or more properly, not become
  inconsistent due to the operation of this protocol).

  The test suites to exercise this protocol are located in "tests/rhizomeprotocol".

  The above functionality resolves down to several specific functions:

  1. Ability to enquire running servald and generate a list of BARs that it has
  stored, and present that list of "IHAVE"'s to the far end for examination.

  2. Ability to respond to such a list of BAR's, compare the list to the local
  servald instance's Rhizome database, and send back a list of "IHAVE"'s for any
  bundles that are newer than those presented in the list, or that were not present
  in the list.

  3. Ability to parse such a list of "IHAVE"'s, and from that determine the set of
  bundles to synchronise in each direction.

  4. As each server may have very many bundles, the above transactions must be able
  to operate on a limited range of bundle-IDs.  Each request shall therefore include
  the lowest and highest bundle-ID covered by the list.

  Note that the above actions are between the two Rhizome Direct processes, and not
  the Serval daemon processes (although each Rhizome Direct process will necessarily
  need to communicate with their local Serval daemon instances).

  5. Ability to present a BAR to the remote end Serval daemon instance and fetch the
  associated data bundle, and then present it to the local Serval daemon instance
  for adding to the local Rhizome database.

  It is recognised that the Serval daemon's real-time behaviour is compromised by
  the current mechanism for importing bundles into the Rhizome database.  This will
  be addressed as part of the on-going development of the main Rhizome protocol, and
  its rectification is beyond the scope of Rhizome Direct.

  6. Ability to present manifest and associated data for a bundle to the remote
  Rhizome Direct process for that process to schedule its insertion into the Rhizome
  database.

  As with the existing Rhizome protocol, it seems reasonable to use HTTP as the
  basis. The interactions will be M2M, so we do not need a fully-fledged HTTP
  server at this stage, but can make use of our own spartan HTTP server already
  integrated into servald.

  In light of the above, all rhizome services and HTTP services are being
  transitioned from running in the main servald process, into a separate process
  started by servald calling fork() (but not exec, since the same starting image
  will be fine).

   direct about which bundles to send or receive, or to fetch/push them itself.
