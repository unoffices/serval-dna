Notes for Serval DNA Developers
===============================
[Serval Project][], December 2017

Introduction
------------

This document is intended for all developers of [Serval DNA][], and also for
non-developers who are experiencing errors in the [build][] process.

Autotools
---------

The [configure.ac][] file is an [autoconf][] script that contains instructions
for adapting the build of Serval DNA to different platforms and CPU
architectures.  This script makes use of many [GNU M4][] macros, each of which
tests an aspect of the build environment, such as the make and version of the C
compiler (eg, [GCC][], [Clang][]), the availability of headers, functions and
system calls in the standard library, and so forth.

Most of these M4 macros are standard, either supplied with [autoconf][] or from
the [autoconf macro archive][].  Some macros are specific to Serval DNA, either
to improve on a standard macro or perform a test for which no standard macro
exists.  These extra macros are locally defined in files within the [m4](../m4)
sub-directory.

The [autoreconf][] command used in the [build][] instructions generates an
`aclocal.m4` file that includes all the necessary files from the [m4](../m4)
directory.  In turn, it then includes this `aclocal.m4` file when invoking [GNU
M4][] to convert the [configure.ac][] file into the `./configure` script.

When invoked without arguments, all [autoreconf][] versions up to 2.69 will
emit warning messages like this:

    $ cd serval-dna
    $ aclocal
    configure.ac:19: warning: Unsupported attribute section, the test may fail
    ../../lib/autoconf/lang.m4:224: AC_LANG_SOURCE is expanded from...
    ../../lib/autoconf/lang.m4:241: AC_LANG_PROGRAM is expanded from...
    ../../lib/autoconf/lang.m4:193: AC_LANG_CONFTEST is expanded from...
    ../../lib/autoconf/general.m4:2672: _AC_LINK_IFELSE is expanded from...
    ../../lib/autoconf/general.m4:2689: AC_LINK_IFELSE is expanded from...
    ../../lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4:639: AS_IF is expanded from...
    ../../lib/autoconf/general.m4:2042: AC_CACHE_VAL is expanded from...
    ../../lib/autoconf/general.m4:2063: AC_CACHE_CHECK is expanded from...
    /usr/share/aclocal/ax_gcc_var_attribute.m4:57: AX_GCC_VAR_ATTRIBUTE is expanded from...
    configure.ac:19: the top level
    $

These messages mean that the generated `aclocal.m4` file does not contain the
M4 macros provided by Serval DNA, but instead contains the default ones that
from the [autoconf macro archive][].  As a consequence, the `./configure`
script may not test for certain features correctly, leading to compilation
failure or subtle bugs.

The correct way to invoke [autoreconf][] versions 2.69 or earlier is to give
the `-I m4` option, which will eliminate the warnings:

    $ cd serval-dna
    $ autoreconf -f -i -I m4
    $

The `-I m4` option should be unnecessary in [autoreconf][] versions 2.70 and
later, because they will deduce it from the `AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR([m4])`
directive near the top of [configure.ac][].

Linker
------

The default GNU linker (based on the BFD library) does not support relocation
of some symbols produced by the Swift compiler:

    relocation R_X86_64_PC32 against protected symbol `...' can not be used when making a shared object

The Serval DNA dynamic library is linked using the GNU [gold][] linker
(available in GNU binutils since 2008), which does not have this problem.

libsodium
---------

[Serval DNA][] uses the [libsodium][] cryptographic library for elliptic curve
encryption, authentication and secure hashing.

[libsodium][] is a portable, cross-compilable fork of [NaCl][], with a
compatible API.  The design choices in NaCl-libsodium, particularly in regard
to the [Curve25519][] Diffie-Hellman function, emphasise security, and the
“magic constants" in NaCl-libsodium have clear rationales.  By contrast, the
[NIST][] standard curves emphasise “performance" at the cost of security and do
not describe the specific origins of certain constants.  Despite the emphasis
on higher security, NaCl-libsodium primitives are faster across-the-board than
most implementations of the NIST standards.

A copy of the libsodium source code is embedded within the Serval DNA source
code under the `libsodium` subdirectory, using [git subtree][].  Developers do
not need to take any special steps to compile or install this libsodium source
code, because Serval DNA does it automatically:

* the [autoreconf][] command automatically recurses into the libsodium
  subdirectory;
* [Autotools](#autotools) `./configure` script automatically runs the
  `libsodium/configure` script;
* the `make` command automatically recurses into the libsodium directory *the
  first time that it is run*.

The Serval DNA build system has not been set up to facilitate development of
the libsodium source code itself.  The Serval DNA `make` command will only
recurse into the libsodium directory the first time it runs.  If a developer
subsequently alters a libsodium source file, he/she must run `cd libsodium;
make` manually to compile it, then run the Serval DNA `make`, which will
recompile the entire Serval DNA source code.

Upgrading libsodium
-------------------

To upgrade the embedded [libsodium](#libsodium) source code to a later version,
for example to its (hypothetical) tag `1.0.77`:

    $ cd serval-dna
    $ git subtree pull --prefix libsodium git@github.com:jedisct1/libsodium.git \
          --squash 1.0.77 --message 'Merge libsodium 1.0.77'
    $

Beware: Git does not support rebasing of subtree merge commits.

Debian/Ubuntu
-------------

A single [apt-get][] command will install all mandatory and testing
dependencies before building on [Debian][] and [Ubuntu][] systems:

    $ sudo apt-get --yes install libc6-dev jq curl
    Reading package lists... Done

Apple Mac OS X
--------------

### Test utilities

The [OS X grep(1)][] , [OS X sed(1)][] and [OS X awk(1)][] tools provided by
Apple Mac OS X are the BSD variants.  The [test scripts][] require the GNU
variants with the names *ggrep*, *gsed* and *gawk*, which can be installed on
Mac OS X using the [homebrew][] package manager:

    $ brew tap homebrew/dupes
    ==> Tapping homebrew/dupes

    ==> Caveats
    The command has been installed with the prefix "g".
    If you do not want the prefix, install using the "with-default-names" option.
    If you need to use these commands with their normal names, you
    can add a "gnubin" directory to your PATH from your bashrc like:
    PATH="/usr/local/opt/gnu-sed/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"
    Additionally, you can access their man pages with normal names if you add
    the "gnuman" directory to your MANPATH from your bashrc as well:
    MANPATH="/usr/local/opt/gnu-sed/libexec/gnuman:$MANPATH"
    ==> Summary

    $

Java
----

The Serval DNA *libservaldeamon* static and dynamic libraries provide a [JNI][]
API so that the Serval [command line][CLI] can be called from Java programs,
and the daemon server can be run in a Java thread.

Swift
-----

Serval DNA supports [Swift][], the language that Apple recommend for developing
iOS apps for their mobile devices such as phones and tablets.  The
`./configure` script [generated from configure.ac](#autotools) detects whether
a [Swift 4][] compiler is present, or failing that, a [Swift 3][] compiler, and
if so, then produces a Makefile that will compile
[servaldswift.swift](../servaldswift.swift) into the *servaldswift* executable,
to prove that the Swift [module map](../module.modulemap) allows Swift source
code to invoke internal Serval DNA functions.

The `./configure` script can be passed the following variables, either as
environment variables or using the `VARNAME=value` syntax on its command line:

* `SWIFTC` the path name of the Swift compiler to use; by default the configure
  script searches `$PATH` for `swiftc`

* `SWIFTCFLAGS` extra command-line arguments to pass to the Swift compiler;
  analogous to `CFLAGS` for the C compiler

Swift Client API
----------------

Serval DNA provides a *Swift Client API* as a [Swift module][] called
**ServalClient**, which provides access to the services of the Serval DNA
daemon through its [REST API][].

The Swift client API is written entirely in [Swift][] using the [URLSession][]
Foundation class and related classes as the HTTP client.  The API is covered
by its own [test scripts][].  To date only the following parts of the [REST
API][] are supported:

* [Keyring REST API][], test script is [keyringswift](../tests/keyringswift)

Using Swift modules
-------------------

To use a [Swift module][] in your Swift program:

* add the directory containing the *ModuleName.swiftmodule* and
  *ModuleName.swiftdoc* files to your Swift import path, so the Swift source
  code can use `import ModuleName` to access the API definition;

* include the `libModuleName.a` static library in the link command line, either
  by giving its path explicitly as an argument, or by adding its containing
  directory to the link search path with the `-L` option and giving the
  `-lModuleName` option on the link command line.

About the examples
------------------

The examples in this document are [Bourne shell][] commands, using standard
quoting and variable expansion.  Commands issued by the user are prefixed with
the shell prompt `$` to distinguish them from the output of the command.
Single and double quotes around arguments are part of the shell syntax, so are
not seen by the command.  Lines ending in backslash `\` continue the command on
the next line.

The directory paths used in the examples are for illustrative purposes only,
and may need to be changed for your particular circumstances.
