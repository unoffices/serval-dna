Keyring REST API
================
[Serval Project][], December 2017

Introduction
------------

The [Serval Mesh network][] is based on [cryptographic identities][] that can
easily be created by any node at any time.  Each [Serval DNA][] daemon that
runs on a node in the network stores its own identities in the [Keyring][], an
encrypted store protected by passwords, and gives applications access to the
Keyring via the **Keyring REST API** described in this document.  Using this
API, client applications can add, remove, unlock, lock, query, and modify
identities in the keyring.

Basic concepts
--------------

### Serval ID

Every identity in the [Serval mesh network][] is represented by its **Serval
ID**, (usually abbreviated to [SID][], and formerly known as “Subscriber ID”),
which is a unique 256-bit public key in the [Curve25519][] *crypto-box* key
space.  The SID is used:

*  as the network address in the [Serval Mesh network][]
*  to encrypt [MDP][] messages
*  to identify the senders, recipients and authors of [Rhizome bundles][]
*  to identify the parties in a [MeshMS conversation][]

The Serval ID public key is derived from the *Serval ID secret key*, which is
generated when the identity is first created, and stored in the keyring.  The
original implementation of [Serval DNA][] generated the *Serval ID secret key*
at random, but since the introduction of [combined IDs](#combined-ids), the
secret key is derived from the [Serval Signing ID](#serval-signing-id) secret
key.

### Serval Signing ID

Every identity in the [Serval mesh network][] has a **Serval Signing ID**,
which is a unique 256-bit public key in the [Curve25519][] *crypto-sign* key
space that is generated by choosing a *secret signing key* at random when the
the identity is first created.  The Signing ID is used:

*  to prevent forgery of [Serval Mesh network][] routing messages
*  to authenticate non-encrypted [MDP][] messages

The large size of the key space means that, as long as the secret key choice
is truly random, the [probability of two identities having the same
ID][birthday paradox] is negligible, even if billions of identities are
generated.

### Combined IDs

Since July 2016, [Serval DNA][] generates [Serval ID](#serval-id)s by deriving
them from the [Serval Signing ID](#serval-signing-id), so when creating a new
identity, only a single secret key is generated at random instead of two.  This
change was made possible by replacing the [NaCl][] cryptographic library with
[libsodium][], which provides a primitive to map keys from the *crypto-sign*
key space to the *crypto-box* key space (but not vice versa, which is
mathematically impossible).

These related keys are called *combined IDs*.

Eventually, the [Serval ID](#serval-id) will be replaced by the [Serval Signing
ID](#serval-signing-id) throughout the Serval software and protocols, but will
still be called “Serval ID”.  The encryption key (in the *crypto-box* key
space) will be derived from the signing key on the fly whenever needed, so there
will only be one kind of Serval ID, which will be a great simplification.

### DID

The **DID** ([Dialled Identity][]) is a telephone number, represented as a
string of between 5 and 31 ASCII characters from the set `123456789#0*`.  It is
used by the [DNA][] protocol to allow [Serval mesh network][] users to discover
each other by telephone number; the first step in establishing a mesh voice
call.

### Name

The **Name** is a short, unstructured string between 1 and 63 bytes in length,
assigned by a human user to an identity.  It is used to represent the identity
to human users, as it is more recognisable than a hexadecimal [SID](#serval-id)
or a [DID](#did) (telephone number).

Serval DNA does not interpret the name, merely stores it, so the name may use
any encoding on which all clients agree, such as ASCII or [UTF-8][].  Since it
is intended for human consumption, it is recommended that it contain only
printable characters, that it contain no carriage-motion characters (eg, TAB
U+0009 or LF U+0010), and that it not start or end with white space, but Serval
DNA does not enforce any such rules.  The only restriction enforced by Serval
DNA is that it contain no zero bytes.

### Rhizome Secret

The *Rhizome Secret* is a secret key, separate from the [SID](#serval-id)
secret, that is generated randomly for each new identity, and stored in the
keyring as part of the identity.  The Rhizome Secret is used to securely encode
the [Bundle Secret][] of a bundle into its [manifest][], in the form of the
[Bundle Key][], thus relieving [Rhizome][] applications of the burden of having
to store and protect Bundle Secrets themselves.

### PIN

When an identity is created, it can optionally be given a PIN (passphrase).  If
the PIN is *empty* then the identity is permanently unlocked (visible).

Identities with a non-empty PIN are stored encrypted in the keyring file.
Inspection of the keyring file will not reveal their presence unless the
correct PIN is supplied, because all unused entries in the keyring file are
filled with pseudo-random content that is indistinguishable from encrypted
identities.

If a PIN is lost and forgotten, then the identity (identities) it unlocks will
remain locked and unusable forever.  There is no “master PIN” or back-door.

### Identity unlocking

All Keyring requests can supply a passphrase using the optional **pin**
parameter, which unlocks all keyring identities protected by that passphrase,
prior to performing the request.  Serval DNA caches every PIN it receives until
the PIN is revoked using the [lock request](#get-restful-keyring-lock), so once
an identity is unlocked, it remains visible until explicitly locked.

Keyring REST API common features
--------------------------------

### Keyring JSON result

All Keyring requests relating to a single identity that do not produce a
special response content for the outcome, return the following augmented [JSON
result][] object as the HTTP response content:

    {
        "http_status_code": ...,
        "http_status_message": "...",
        "identity": {
            "sid": "<hex64>",
            "identity": "<hex64>",
            "did": "...",
            "name": "..."
        }
    }

*  the `sid` field is the [SID](#serval-id); a string containing 64 uppercase
   hexadecimal digits
*  the `identity` field is the [Signing Id](#serval-signing-id); a string
   containing 64 uppercase hexadecimal digits
*  the `did` field is the string [DID](#did); omitted if the identity has no DID
*  the `name` field is the string [Name](#name); omitted if the identity has no
   name

Keyring REST API operations
---------------------------

### GET /restful/keyring/identities.json

Returns a list of all currently unlocked identities, one identity per row in
[JSON table][] format.  The following parameters are recognised:

*   **pin**: see [identity unlocking](#identity-unlocking)

The table columns are:

| heading    | content                                                                   |
|:---------- |:------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sid`      | the [SID](#serval-id), a string of 64 uppercase hex digits                |
| `identity` | the [Signing ID](#serval-signing-id), a string of 64 uppercase hex digits |
| `did`      | the optional [DID](#did) (telephone number); `null` if none is assigned   |
| `name`     | the optional string [Name](#name); `null` if none is assigned             |

### GET /restful/keyring/add

Creates a new identity with a random [SID](#serval-id).  The following
parameters are recognised:

*   **pin**: if present, then the new identity is protected by the given
    passphrase; see [identity unlocking](#identity-unlocking) -- note that the
    newly created identity is already unlocked when this request returns,
    because the passphrase has been added to the PIN cache
*   **did**: the DID (phone number); empty or absent to indicate no DID,
    otherwise must conform to the rules for [DID](#did)
*   **name**: the name; empty or absent to specify no name, otherwise must
    conform to the rules for [Name](#name)

If any parameter contains an invalid value then the request returns [400 Bad
Request][400].  Returns [201 Created][201] if an identity is created; the [JSON
result](#keyring-json-result) describes the identity that was created.

### GET /restful/keyring/SID/remove

Removes an existing identity with a given [SID](#serval-id).  The following
parameters are recognised:

*   **pin**: see [identity unlocking](#identity-unlocking)

If there is no unlocked identity with the given SID, this request returns [404
Not Found][404].  Otherwise it returns [200 OK][200] and the [JSON
result](#keyring-json-result) describes the identity that was removed.

### GET /restful/keyring/SID/set

Sets and/or clears the [DID](#did) and/or [Name](#name) of the unlocked
identity that has the given [SID](#serval-id).  The following parameters are
recognised:

*   **pin**: see [identity unlocking](#identity-unlocking)
*   **did**: the DID (phone number); empty to clear the DID, otherwise must
    conform to the rules for [DID](#did)
*   **name**: the name; empty to clear the name, otherwise must conform to the
    rules for [Name](#name)

If any parameter contains an invalid value then the request returns [400 Bad
Request][400].  If there is no unlocked identity with the given SID, this
request returns [404 Not Found][404].

### GET /restful/keyring/SID/lock

Locks an existing identity with a given [SID](#serval-id).

If there is no unlocked identity with the given SID, this request returns [404
Not Found][404].  Otherwise it returns [200 OK][200] and the [JSON
result](#keyring-json-result) describes the identity that was locked.
